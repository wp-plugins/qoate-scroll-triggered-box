This box is great to encourage your readers to share your content, cause it will only show up when a visitor has reached a certain part of your page. This ensures that the visitor liked your content, making this a great spot to ask them to take action.

**Features:**

* Highly customizable
* Easy social bookmarks (Twitter, FB, StumbleUpon, Digg, Delicious, RSS, MySpace, LinkedIn, Reddit,
 Technorati, Tumblr, Google, Netvibes, Mixx, Posterous, FriendFeed)
* OR custom HTML content, meaning you can show pretty much anything you want in the box.
* Choose between a slide or fade animation
* Choose the placement of the box
* Configure when the box should show up: percentage of page height, end of post, after comments
* Choose whether visitors should be able to minimize the box
* More..
